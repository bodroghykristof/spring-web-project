If no circular dependencies exist, when one or more collaborating beans are being
injected into a dependent bean, each collaborating bean is totally configured prior
to being injected into the dependent bean.

The depends-on attribute can specify both an initialization-time dependency and,
in the case of singleton beans only, a corresponding destruction-time dependency.
Dependent beans that define a depends-on relationship with a given bean are destroyed first,
prior to the given bean itself being destroyed.
Thus, depends-on can also control shutdown order.
